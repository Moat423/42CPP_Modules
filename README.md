 42 C++ Modules

A comprehensive implementation of the 42 School C++ curriculum modules, demonstrating progressive mastery of C++ concepts and techniques.

## About This Repository

This repository contains implementations and documentation for the C++ modules from 42 School's curriculum. Each module focuses on specific C++ concepts, building progressively from fundamental principles to more advanced techniques.

The code follows the C++98 standard as required by the curriculum, showcasing clean implementation and proper understanding of core language features.

## üóÇÔ∏è Modules Overview

| Module | Focus | Key Concepts |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [Module 00](./Module_00) | Namespace, Class, Member functions | Classes, Objects, This, Initialization lists |
| [Module 01](./Module_01) | Memory allocation, References | New/Delete, References vs Pointers, File streams |
| [Module 02](./Module_02) | Ad-hoc polymorphism, Operator overloading | Orthodox Canonical Form, Fixed-point numbers |
| [Module 03](./Module_03) | Inheritance | Class inheritance, Access specifiers, Multiple inheritance |
| [Module 04](./Module_04) | Subtype polymorphism, Abstract classes | Virtual functions, Abstract classes, Interfaces |
| [Module 05](./Module_05) | Exceptions | |

## üìö Key C++ Concepts

This repository demonstrates implementation of various C++ concepts including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Memory Management**: Stack vs heap allocation, new/delete operators
- **Operator & Function Overloading**: Custom implementations for operators
- **Class Relationships**: Inheritance hierarchies, abstract classes
- **Standard Library Usage**: I/O streams, file handling, string manipulation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++98 standard support
- Make

### Compiling and Running
Each module contains multiple exercises, each with its own Makefile:

```bash
# Navigate to an exercise directory
cd Module_XX/exYY

# Compile the exercise
make

# Run the executable (name varies by exercise)
./executable_name [arguments]
```
